# napatsc Personal Hogo Theme

My opinionated Hugo theme for my personal website: <https://napatsc.com>.

## Features

- **Responsive**: looks good from small phone displays to big PC monitors
- **Soothing light/dark theme** with [Catppuccin
palette](https://catppuccin.com/) (Latte/Mocha)
- **Soothing variable fonts** for optimal scaling and reading experience using
[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), [JetBrains
Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), and [Noto Sans
Thai](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Thai).
- **Materials Symbols** cause why not.
- **No JS required**: entire still functioning when disable JS.
- **Functional Navbar**: toggle buttons work without JS
    - **Searching capabilities**: use fast client-side
    [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) search engine or redirect to
    [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) if JS is disabled
- **Tiny deployment size**: HTML/CSS/JS are minified. Fonts are in `woff2`
format and stripped for necessary glyph families only.
- **Anti-tampering**: all scripts have fingerprint checked before imported.
- **Multiple content types** supported: blogs, gallery, projects, recipes,
people, etc. can be in one site.
- **Practical codeblock** with syntax highlighting and copy buttons
- **Heading anchors**: text can be referenced via URL
- **Multilingual** supported: only Thai language for now.
- **SEO friendly** <sup>I'm no SEO wizards but basic boxes are ticked</sup>
- **Breadcrumbs**
- **JpegXL-oriented**: prioritize the superior image codec as the highest
definition/lossless quality. Unsupported browsers will be served with lossy
webp.
